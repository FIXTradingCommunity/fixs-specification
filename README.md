# fixs-specification
This project contains specifications and resources for FIX-over-TLS (FIXS)

FIX-over-TLS (FIXS) is a technical standard that specifies how to use the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol with FIX. It provides some standardization and ensures a minimum level of security is applied. We believe FIXS will make it easier for FIX participants to employ TLS and hope that this will help to improve security across the industry.
